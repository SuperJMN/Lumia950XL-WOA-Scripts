# Installation scripts to install Windows 10 ARM64 on the Lumia 950 XL

Look for the scripts in the `Installation` folder. 

The main script is [`Setup.ps1`](https://github.com/SuperJMN/Lumia950XL-WOA-Scripts/blob/master/Installation/Setup.ps1)

- If you want to do the whole process, execute `Setup.ps1` directly
- If you want to use the script as a reference, it's also OK. Just take a look and execute each script in order, doing what they tell you to do :)
- There are sub-scripts that are called from the main script. You can use them to execute only one part of the process.

For the scripts to run, you have to copy the contents of Files.zip inside the folder named `Installation`. To get the .zip, ask for them in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/Ey6mehEPg0Fe4utQNZ9yjA)).
