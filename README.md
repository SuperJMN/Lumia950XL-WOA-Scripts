# Installation scripts to install Windows 10 ARM64 on the Lumia 950 XL

Look for the scripts in the `Installation` folder. 

The main script is [`FullSetup.ps1`](https://github.com/SuperJMN/Lumia950XL-WOA-Scripts/blob/master/Installation/FullSetup.ps1)

- If you want to do the whole process, execute `FullSetup.ps1` directly
- If you need to reinstall Windows, run `ReinstallWindows.ps1`. Bear in mind that it will wipe the current installation!
- If you want to use the script as a reference, it's also OK. Just take a look and execute each script in order, doing what they tell you to do :)
- There are many sub-scripts that are called from the main script. They are thought to be use by experienced users that know about the correct order and steps, so if you don't know exactly what they do, don't run them!

# Binaries (AKA "the Files")
For the scripts to run, you have to copy the contents of [this Folder](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtXoQFW327DIyLRZLgLlmpx17zXeyw) inside the folder named `Installation`, so you you end up having "Installation\Files\...". Anyways, the script will check if you did it right ;)

Inside you will find Drivers, the UEFI, flashing tools... everything the scripts need to work :)
