# Installation scripts to install Windows 10 ARM64 on the Lumia 950 XL

Look for the scripts in the `Installation` folder. 

The main script is [`FullSetup.ps1`](https://github.com/SuperJMN/Lumia950XL-WOA-Scripts/blob/master/Installation/FullSetup.ps1)

- If you want to do the whole process, execute `FullSetup.ps1` directly
- If you want to use the script as a reference, it's also OK. Just take a look and execute each script in order, doing what they tell you to do :)
- There are sub-scripts that are called from the main script. You can use them to execute only one part of the process.

# Binaries (AKA Files)
For the scripts to run, you have to copy the contents of [this Folder](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtXoQFW327DIyLRZLgLlmpx17zXeyw) inside the folder named `Installation`.
